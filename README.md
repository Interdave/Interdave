## 3. Bio
At the age of just 5 years I was in a special kindergarden for body-related, handicapped individuals. When I went to school I needed a lot of therapy in order to learn how to live a normal life. I got the certificate of secondary education and successfully completed the apprenticeship as a Computer Scientist for Application Development. Since then I love nothing more than exploring the endless possibilities Computer Science has to offer.
